# arkOS Blog

I'm getting started building out my arkOS box on the Raspberry Pi. It's
been a largely good experience, but I have found a few issues that I'm
going to try to diligently document here.

## Dogfooding

I'm up and running with Jekyll for this blog, which is also my first experience
with Jekyll. I have in the past used a similarly concepted static site
generator named Piecrust - it's written in PHP rather than Ruby. Maybe as
a meta post, I'll document the differences I find there.

So far so good. More posts soon.
